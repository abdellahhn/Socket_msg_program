# Socket_msg_program

## Overview

This project involves the development of a messaging application with email-like functionality using Python and sockets. Unlike real-time chat applications, this program is designed for asynchronous communication, resembling the structure of an email service.

## Features

**User Authentication:**
- Users can register with a username and a secure password.
- Authentication ensures a secure and personalized user experience.

**Email Operations:**
- Compose and send emails with a specified recipient, subject, and content.
- Retrieve and read emails from the inbox.
- Logout to end the session securely.

**Server-Client Communication:**
- Utilizes sockets for communication between the server and clients.
- Implements a client-server architecture for effective message exchange.

## Components

### Server

**Initialization:**
- Prepares the server socket for communication.
- Manages client connections and user data.

**User Operations:**
- Handles user registration and login.
- Manages user sessions and logouts.

**Email Management:**
- Manages the creation, storage, and retrieval of emails.
- Provides statistics on the number and size of emails.

**Error Handling:**
- Ensures robust error handling for various scenarios.

### Client

**Connection:**
- Connects to the server using sockets.
- Manages a user session with authentication.

**User Interface:**
- Guides users through registration, login, and menu options.
- Facilitates email-related operations.

## Usage

**Server:**
- Run the server script to initiate the messaging service.

**Client:**
- Execute the client script, providing the server's IP/URL as a parameter.
- Register or login to access the messaging features.
- Compose, send, and read emails as needed.

## Notes

This project focuses on creating an email-like messaging application, prioritizing user authentication, secure communication, and efficient email management. The implementation employs Python and sockets to achieve a robust and functional messaging system.
